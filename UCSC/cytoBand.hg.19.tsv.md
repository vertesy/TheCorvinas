The items in the last column refer to the coloring you see in the both the
Browser graphic and in the ideogram above. The first 5 in the list below
reflect the level of color obtained via Giemsa staining; 

- "acen" is centromeric;
- "stalk" refers to the short arm of acrocentric chromosomes chr13,14,15,21,22;
- "gvar" bands tend to be heterochomatin, either pericentric or telomeric.

The best way to see for your self is to look at the regions in the Genome
Browser.
