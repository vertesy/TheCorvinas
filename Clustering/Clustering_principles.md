# Clustering


Clustering is done on a pair-wise distance matrix of variables. 
For a cell-by-genes data frame, this distance can be:

1. Euclidean distance of cells in gene expression space
2. 1-(gene expression correlation) between each pair of cells
3. In *RaceID*, it is the euclidean distance of correlation vectors.

Explanatory figures will be attached soon.
