#' ## Overview
#' I wanted to see if there's any relationship between the amount of money
#' a country spends on research and development (R&D) and the number of Nobel
#' Prize laureates produed by the country.
#' I expect that there is such a relationship to some extent. While money spent
#' on R&D does not necessarily mean the money is going towards science-based R&D
#' for example, it can



# try.dev.off()
MyGauss = rnorm(1000)
hist(MyGauss, col = "gold1")


#-
MyPoiss = rpois(1000, lambda = 7)
hist(MyPoiss, col = "gold1")

#+ fig.width=5, fig.height=5
plot(cars)
plot(1)
