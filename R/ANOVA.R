# Another multiple comparisons procedure is Tukeyâ€Ÿs method (a.k.a. Tukey's Honest Significance Test). The function TukeyHSD() creates a set of confidence intervals on the differences between means with the specified family-wise probability of coverage. The general form is
# TukeyHSD(x, conf.level = 0.95)
# Here x is a fitted model object (e.g., an aov fit) and conf.level is the confidence level.
# TukeyHSD(results, conf.level = 0.95)

TukeyHSD(results, conf.level = 0.95)
